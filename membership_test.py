## membership_test.m is a function that tests whether a point lies on an 
## ellipse, the co-gradient locus of two ellipses and checks in general the
## point's membership in sets of interest.
#
# Given a point 'x' and the parameter sets E_i and E_j for two ellipses, 
# this function computes the distance of the point from the first ellipse 
# and checks its relationship to the second ellipseâ€™s co-gradient locus. 
# It also checks a condition related to the inner product of the ellipses' 
# vectors.
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Inputs:
#   x    - Point to test [x, y]
#   E_i  - Parameter set of the first ellipse [a, b, theta, o_x, o_y]
#   E_j  - Parameter set of the second ellipse [a, b, theta, o_x, o_y]
#
# Outputs:
#   ellipse  - Scalar value representing the distance of the point `x` from 
#              the first ellipse (based on the quadratic form), must equal
#              1 (or 1.0000).
#   locus    - Vector representing the cross product of the vectors from 
#              the point 'x' to the centers of the ellipses, indicating 
#              whether the point is on the co-gradient locus, must equal
#              [0; 0; 0]
#   bon_point - Boolean value indicating whether the dot product of the 
#               vectors from 'x' to the ellipses' centers is negative, 
#               suggesting a certain geometrical relationship, must be 1
